we 've been working together as a team for almost 3 months

it was a tedious journey but worthy

below i will be talking a bit bout the robot who won the 2nd place in the competition (pics in repo)


we used two ir sensor to sense the black area and white area ooh! i forget to mention the arena , ok the arena was a circle with 150 cm diaameter

and 10 cm of white circle surronding the black area , 
ok the two ir sensor was in the front and in the back

we also used one ultrasonic to measure the distance between the opponent and decide whether to attack or not

the stratgey we adopt is to spin around until the robot find the opponent then it will go forward to push him out of ring
